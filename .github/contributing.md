As this is a project for my own benefit, I am not looking for contributions which is probably lucky as I doubt anybody else is interested :-).

I know the code is not great (that’s the whole learning c# bit).

If someone has a burning issue then they can propose a change and I will probably include it but only if I can learn something from it.
